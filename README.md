# TRY ASYNC/AWAIT in caolan async library

This repository is created to test the async library before put in my code. Previously, I have used async library but in callback style. So, my current software is upgrading to add data analytics feature. It is easier if we write in async/await style. Avoid CALLBACK HELL is my target.
